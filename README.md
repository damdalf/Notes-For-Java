# Notes-For-Java
Hello! This is how I prefer to take notes when it comes to learning any programming language. I have always been a pen and paper kind of note-taker, 
but that doesn't cut it when it comes to learning how to program. Not only is it too slow but it prevents you froming copying down examples of code, or easily inserting explanatory visuals into your notes. By using Visual Studio Code, this [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.Theme-MarkdownKit), and writing your notes in Markdown.

All of what you are currently seeing has been done using Markdown. Pretty cool right? Not only is knowing how to write in Markdown a very eaasy skill to learn, 
it can be pretty useful. And as an added bonus, you can now easily access your code wherever and whenever you need!
> Pretty neat, right?
You can write code examples, insert images, create horizontal lines, insert YouTube videos etc. etc. The options are endless.

### Code:

```Java
public int binarySearch(int[] arr)
{
  int size = arr.length();
  
  if(arr.length == 0 || arr = null)
  {
    return -1;
  }
  //...
  //TODO
  //...
}
```
