## Topic:

* GitHub - Version control system. 
* MySQL - Relational database.
* JDBC - API that allows a database to be accessed.
* Spring & SpringBoot - Spring => SpringBoot, two of the most popular frameworks for Java.

* Lots of Advanced Stuff

>This is an example of what the vocabulary section of the notes should look like. By having the definitions away from the conceptual ideas or code examples,
>it promotes more organization and future memory for the discussed material.

## Code and Concepts:

```Java
public int testFunction()
{
    //This is an example of how easy it can be to create Java code inside a body of Markdown text.
    if(testFunction.check() == 1)
    {
        return true;
    }
    else
    {
        return false;
    }

}
```

>While this may seem difficult to grap initially, it ends up being quite nice to look at, and Markdown begins to become a bit more intuitive as time goes on. This is much faster than trying to take notes on pen and paper, and you also get to actually write out code examples rather than making half-ass attempts to  write down the example before your professor moves on.

## Neat. What are the basic commands?
* Headers are clarified using '# text', '## text', ... and so forth, each decreasing in size.

* To create a bulleted list such as this, simply do the following: '* KIDS - kickin' incredibly dope shit.'

* To do the little subcomments (which are great for providing explanations of certain material) are created using: '> This would be my comment.'
* To create a block of code do this, but use backticks, not front ticks: '''Java public class{...};'''
